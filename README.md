### Data

#### Raw Data

The core data used for this project consists of information about tennis tournaments, matches, and players through time dating back to the late 1800s for ATP and early 1900s for WTA. It is available on github in Jeff Sackmann's repos:

- [tennis_wta](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_wta)

- [tennis_atp](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp)

Additionally, we use betting odds for tennis matches after 2000, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hakeem/atp-and-wta-tennis-data) and on [github](https://github.com/chief-r0cka/MLT).

#### Preprocessed Data

Due to constraints on file size, cleaned and aggregated data is stored in CSV files in a shared drive (request access [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14wodIUZZj7R28aX-mTczlzbZ5z_Nh_bw?usp=sharing)).
